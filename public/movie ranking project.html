<h1> The Best Movies According to Federica</h1>
<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>This is one of the most intriguing thrillers of all time. <br />
    With a constant leap between reality and dreams, it keeps 
    you glued to the screen,<br /> 
    trying to figure out whether what 
    you see is part of the conscious or the subconscious.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>Comprising 8 films, it is one of the most magical sagas of all time.</p>

<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>A great animated film that brought about an evolution in the field 
    of animation,<br /> 
    target audience, and a renewal in how fairy tales are
    told.</p>
